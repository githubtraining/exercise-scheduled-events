## About this exercise

:warning: A grading script exists under `.github/workflows/grading.yml`. You do not need to use this workflow for any purpose and **altering its contents will affect the repository's ability to assess your exercise and give feedback.**

:warning: This exercise utilizes [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), which is free for public repositories and self-hosted runners, but may incur charges on private repositories. See *[About billing for GitHub Actions]* to learn more.

:information_source: The use of GitHub actions also means that it may take the grading workflow a few seconds and sometimes minutes to run.

## Instructions

In the `.github/workflows/stale-weekly.yml` you'll find a workflow that is intended to check for and close stale issues every Monday. The workflow is complete **except for** the `on:` key.


Please complete the instructions below:
1. Create your own copy of this repository by using the [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) button.
2. On your repository, edit the `on:` key of the `stale-weekly.yml` workflow so that it contains a trigger to run every Monday.

## Seeing your result

Your exercise is graded automatically once you have completed the instructions. To see the result of your exercise, click the **Actions** tab, select the **Grading workflow**, and select the most recent workflow run. The status of the workflow indicates if you have passed or failed the exercise.

If the workflow failed, scroll down to the **Annotations** section to check what went wrong.

See *[Viewing workflow run history]* if you need assistance.

## Troubleshooting

 If the grading workflow does not automatically run after you complete the instructions, run the troubleshooter: in the **Actions** tab select the **Grading workflow**, click **Run workflow**, select the appropriate branch, and click the **Run workflow** button.

See *[Running a workflow on GitHub]* if you need assistance.
